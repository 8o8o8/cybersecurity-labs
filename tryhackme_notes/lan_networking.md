# TryHackMe – LAN Networking

## Key Concepts
- LAN = Local Area Network, connects devices within a limited area (e.g. home, office).
- Switches forward traffic within the LAN.
- Routers connect LANs to external networks (e.g. the Internet).
- IP addressing + Subnetting determine how devices communicate.

## Hands-On
- Ran ping to verify device reachability.
- Ran 	racert to see hops between my PC → router → ISP → Google.

## Takeaways
- LAN is the foundation of networking.
- Ping = checks reachability/latency.
- Traceroute = shows path between devices.
